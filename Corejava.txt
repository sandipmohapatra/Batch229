interface bank
{
	void input();
	void display();
}

public class First implements bank
{

	@Override
	public void input() {
	System.out.println("This is input data");
	}

	@Override
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("This is display data");
		
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		First ob=new First();
		ob.display();
		ob.input();
	}
}


interface:- It contains only abstract methods.That is method without body.
we cannot create object of an interface.
we have to implement it into a child class.we have to override all the abstract methods and create object of a child class.

override means the same function repeated in the child class with body.
---------------------
why we use interface ?
the important points are mentioned in the interface.
we are going to create a bank project.
client requirement is 
1)registration of customer to open account
2)withdraw money /deposite money
3)apply for credit/debit card
4)apply for various loans
----------------------------------------------
all the methods will be written into a interface and the devlopers will override and complete all the requirements.
